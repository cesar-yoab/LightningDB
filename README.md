LightningDB is a hobby project that aims to replicate the functionality of the popular Redis database using the Rust programming language. This project provides an in-memory key-value store that can be used as a simple caching layer, or as a data structure server for complex applications.

## Features

Rust-Redis supports the following features:

- In-memory key-value store: All data is stored in RAM, making it ideal for fast read/write operations.
- String data type: Key-value pairs can store any string value.
- Basic operations: Supports basic Redis operations like SET, GET, and DEL.
- Persistence: Supports persistence to disk through serialization and deserialization of data.

## Usage
